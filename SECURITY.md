Include, where possible:

- A description of the issue and its impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Affected version(s) and configuration

allow reasonable time for a fix before any public disclosure.

## Scope Notes

This repository ships Postman v2.1 and Bruno collections plus the
zero-dependency Node ESM build scripts that generate them from the
OpenAPI spec. Hardening expectations:

- The shipped collections use Postman variable placeholders
  (`{{accountSid}}`, `{{apiKey}}`) and the Bruno environment file
  declares the same. Do not commit a populated environment file —
  the placeholders carry no secret value by design.
- The build scripts (`scripts/build.mjs`, `scripts/validate.mjs`)
  read the OpenAPI YAML/JSON and write only into the repo tree;
  they make no network calls.

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in Postman, Bruno, or third-party
clients that consume these collections; credential leakage caused
by environment files that were populated and committed downstream.
